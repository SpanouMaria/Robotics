# Robotics Project

Welcome to the "Robotics Project," a simulation of a mobile robot named Jackal and a robotic manipulator called Rrbot, both implemented in Python. The goal is to run a simulation for both robots and navigate them through a virtual environment.


## Jackal Mobile Robot
**Objective:** Calculate the required trajectories of Jackal, using the given data.
**How to control:** Use the command-line to control Jackal.
**Feedback:** Observe the final position of Jackal.

## Rrbot Arm
**Objective:** Calculate the required trajectories of Rrbot, using the given data.
**How to control:** Use the command-line to control Rrbot.
**Feedback:** Observe the final angle of Rrbot.


## Implementation Details
- To give commands to the robot, we use the command-line.
- Using the Gazebo environment, you can add obstacles.


## How to Run
**Clone the Repository:**
    
**Ensure you have Python installed:** The game requires Python 3. Ensure you have it installed on your system.
**Ensure you have ROS installed:** The simulation requires ROS 1. Ensure you have it installed on your system.
**Run the Game:**
